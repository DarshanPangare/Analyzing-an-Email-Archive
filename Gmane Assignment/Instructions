 First run gmane.py to scrape the web (gmane.dr-chuck.net) and create the SQLite Database(content.sqlite).
 Important: Do not use low counts like 1, 20, 100, 300. You can run gmane multiple times to download more messages.
 Now, run the gmodel.py file to create the index.sqlite database.
 You can run the gbasic.py file to dump any number of messages you want.
 In order to get the line visualization, run the gline.py file and open the gline.htm file in your web browser.
 In order to get the word visualization, run the gword.py file and open the gword.htm file in your web browser.
